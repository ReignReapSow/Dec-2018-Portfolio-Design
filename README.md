A portfolio design to showcase my lastest skills, experiences, and work.
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>CSS FLEXBOX</li>
</ul>

## NOTE
This Project will be a slow on going process, because...<br> 
(Some times the best designs are the one's you build on like a brick house)</span><br> 
    -Learning and reviewing new & old technologies simultaneously<br> 
    -Learning GIT through the command line<br>
    -Continuously updated as I learn more GIT and better ways to showcase my projects.<br>
    -New projects will be added to the portfolio site as I create them.<br>
    -PRACTICE is the best teacher, so my latest skills will be implemented into the site as I grow.<br>

## Technologies
Front-end (html, css, scss, js)<br>
Back-end (Reactjs, Nodejs)<br>
